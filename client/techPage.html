				My interest in computer science began in senior year of high school when I took AP Computer Science. Despite a formidable teacher and an utter lack of estrogen, I fell in love with the problem solving aspect of programming. I realized that coding had unbounded potential and was integral to modern day life. With those same beliefs in mind, I am now currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science but have since diversified my programming education to include different avenues of the field. I tutor middle school kids in Java and Front End Development, worked on a research team within the Stanford HCI department this summer to build a workflow of microtasks to teach humor, and am looking forward to being an instructor this upcoming school year for a one unit class, CS 1U: Practical Unix. Despite the many rollercoasters and pitfalls this subject has led me through, I remain excited for the future of technology and ready to be a part of shaping it!
