				I have been dancing from the age of 5 and since then, it's played a central role in my life! I began my training in the Indian Classical dance form known as Odissi, under the tutelage of Smt. Nandita Behera. I have been fortunate enough to travel both nationally and internationally performing Odissi at such venues as the International Orissa Festival in India. I was also named a National YoungArts semifinalist for my submission in the International Classical Dance category. I later branched into the Western forms picking up jazz, hip-hop and contemporary technique along the way! I began to meld these two styles, Eastern and Western, into a fusion art form that spoke to me with its Western lyricism and Eastern rhythm. I was president of my high school's dance company and am currently on dV8, one of Stanford's performance-based hip-hop groups. You can find some of my performances <a target="_blank" href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL25WCOoDm0" class = "youtubeLink">here</a>.
